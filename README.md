## About Me

I am a Computer Science student passionate about expanding my skillset. I enjoy working on various projects that help me learn and grow in this field. In my free time, I like to explore new technologies and contribute to open source.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an automated system to extract the vasculature from images of the lungs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Python and how abstract data structures in Python can be used to generate desired information for a given user.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about medical image data processing, abstract data structures and their corresponding algorithms, Java, Python, SQL, and PHP.
